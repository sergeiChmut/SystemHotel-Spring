 * JDK 8
 
 All other dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted in the included POM file.
 
 ### Test App With Profiles
 
  This application support 2 roles
 
 | Role     | Discription                                       |

 ### Deployment with Docker
 #### 1. Install **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)** 
   Docker Desktop is a tool for MacOS and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices. 
 
   Or install docker for **[Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)**, for example, Ubuntu:
     
```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install docker  
``` 


 #### 2. Use **docker-compose.yml** from the **docker** folder and deploy the application in a few minutes (first time) or in a few seconds (when you get docker's images).
     
   It is very simple, just copies **docker-compose.yml** in your Virtual Machine or PC. (You may create this file with several text lines)
     
   Run deployment with command:
 ```
 docker-compose up -d
 ```
   After docker's output: 
   ```
  Creating network "hoteldockerimage_default" with the default driver
  Creating hoteldockerimage_db_1 ... done
  Creating hoteldockerimage_web_1 ... done
```
    
  Check SystemHotel application at [http://localhost/hotel]  or  [http://YourVirtualMachineIp/hotel]

If you want to see List of docker containers use `docker-compose ps`.

For logs `docker-compose logs -f`

**Clean**
When you want to stop and delete Application use `docker-compose down` - Docker stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes

 
 ### Installing
 
 The project can be installed by creating the war file and deploying it into a server.
 
 ### Running
 
 To run the project locally in an embedded server just use the following Maven command for deploying to Tomcat (after create database):
 
 ```
 mvn tomcat7:run
 ```
 
 With this the project will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080/hotel].
